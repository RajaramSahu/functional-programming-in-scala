"Functional Programming in Scala" exercises
===============================

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises of the [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason) book, published by Manning.

The content of the book is being discussed at the Study Group meetings of the [Vienna Scala User Group](http://www.scala-vienna.org).
